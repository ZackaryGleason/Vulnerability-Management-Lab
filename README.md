<h1>Vulnerability Management</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
During this project I used Nessus Essentials to scan a local VM hosted on VMWare running Windows 10 to run a credentialed scan and discover vulnerabilities. Then I took steps to remediate the vulnerabilities and performed a rescan to verify remediation.

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>VMWare</b>
- <b>Nessus Essentials</b>


Here is the original scan before adding credentials
